Art, as a source of knowledge and a form of communication can provide the ground for the portraying of emotions. You can communicate feelings or moods through art.<br><br>Art is open for multiple interpretations. This is something that design sometimes lacks.<br><br>I always start an assignment by looking at it from an artistic perspective. This helps me to deal with the functions and technicality of design, which can be somewhat limiting in the beginning of a process.I start from a concept and then give it shape. The concept is always more important than the execution.By thinking through art, I can enter a train of thoughts and look differently at ordinary things.<br><br>We are surrounded by boundaries that limit us. And I don’t like to be limited. I don’t let normative boundaries limit me. In my work, I try to break the prescriptions, the rules with which norms are established.. I’m interested in re-contextualizing ordinary things, playing with their functions, creatings different worlds around them. I can depart from a broad range of perspectives to develop a concept but I believe aesthetics plays a big part in my work. This comes from basic human instincts: our search for harmony, balance, rhythm, which we find so often in art. It’s art that gives people a connection with my work.<br><br>I want to evoke an alienating feeling. This feeling of isolation and disorientation overcomes you and makes you think about the interaction between people. I want the viewer to get lost, so that he starts living on the rhythm that I create in this alienating space.</p>
